# Atlus Uprising Portfolio
Since the majority of my coding projects and knowledge are in C++ and Java, the only GLua code for now is the requested demonstration addon. Because I am mainly in cybersecurity, coding is mostly a thing I do for fun and the majority of these projects are just one-off things I made but please don't let that take away from anything.

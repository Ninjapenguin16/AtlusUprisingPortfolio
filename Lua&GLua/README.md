I made this addon shortly after learning the syntax of Lua and with the assistance of the Facepunch Gmod wiki. the addon does two things, the main one is that it adds a centered health bar to the bottom of the screen where the bar goes to the middle instead of the left when drained. The second thing that the addon does is detect if someone has cursed in chat and takes away their flashlight abilities and warns them, upon saying "Sorry" in the chat the player is given their flashlight back.
